# OSRailway Remote

This is an arduino [TTGO T-Display](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display) firmware to control [OSRailway](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4408535) trains using the [OSRailway Train firmware](https://github.com/aligator/OSRailwayTrain).

I am currently also building a first version of a web-ui to control several trains with this firmware:
[OSRailway Control](https://github.com/aligator/OSRailwayControl)

The 3d printable remote control this firmware is for hasn't been done yet.

# Prequisites
